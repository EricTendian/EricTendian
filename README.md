### Hello! üëã

I‚Äôm Eric from Chicago. I‚Äôm a curious engineer that enjoys solving the hardest problems and making a big impact.
I try to seek out simple and elegant solutions whenever possible and love making things more efficient. I‚Äôve been fascinated with how
things work ever since I could hold a screwdriver, and aren‚Äôt afraid to get my hands dirty digging thru source code of some obscure
open source project while finding the root cause of a bug that only can be reproduced on Tuesdays under a full moon while doing
a handstand. I currently work at [Packback](https://www.packback.co/), an EdTech startup I first joined as an intern, where I help build and scale our discussion product
alongside some incredible folks which is now used by hundreds of thousands of students daily. On the side I maintain a police scanner site
called [CrimeIsDown.com](https://crimeisdown.com/) whose code is available [@CrimeIsDown](https://github.com/CrimeIsDown).
I get to do some cool stuff with software-defined radios there.

Check out some of my contribution activity below ‚¨áÔ∏è to see what I'm currently working on.
