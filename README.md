### Hello! 👋

I’m Eric from Chicago. I’m a curious engineer that enjoys solving the hardest problems and making a big impact.
I try to seek out simple and elegant solutions whenever possible and love making things more efficient. I’ve been fascinated with how
things work ever since I could hold a screwdriver, and aren’t afraid to get my hands dirty digging thru source code of some obscure
open source project while finding the root cause of a bug that only can be reproduced on Tuesdays under a full moon while doing
a handstand.

I currently work at [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/) as a Senior Staff Software Engineer on the Infrastructure Engineering team. Previously I worked at [Packback](https://www.packback.co/), an EdTech startup where I joined as engineer #2 and built and scaled their product. On the side I maintain a police scanner site
called [CrimeIsDown.com](https://crimeisdown.com/) whose code is available [@CrimeIsDown](https://github.com/CrimeIsDown).
I get to do some cool stuff with software-defined radios there.
